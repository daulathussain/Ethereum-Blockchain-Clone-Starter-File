## Project Overview

Build and Deploy an Ethereum Blockchain Clone from Scratch | Chat DApp, Block Explorer, Faucet & Native Token | Full Web3 Project

In this Full Web3 Project, you’ll learn how to build and deploy an Ethereum Blockchain Clone from scratch with real-world decentralized applications and core blockchain infrastructure.

This is not a theory-based tutorial — it’s a complete hands-on blockchain engineering project where you create your own Ethereum-like network and connect multiple production-style DApps to it.

🚀 What You’ll Build:

- 🔗 Ethereum Blockchain Clone with your own native token
- 💬 Chat DApp running on your custom blockchain
- 🔍 Block Explorer to track blocks, transactions, and wallet addresses
- 💧 Faucet DApp to distribute free native tokens
- ⚙️ Smart Contract Deployment & Interaction
- 🌐 End-to-End Web3 Architecture

🧠 What You’ll Learn:

- How Ethereum works internally (blocks, transactions, mining)
- How to build a blockchain network from scratch
- Creating and managing a native cryptocurrency
- Deploying and interacting with smart contracts
- Building real Web3 DApps connected to your own blockchain
- Full-stack blockchain development (Blockchain + DApps)

🚀 Tech Stack Used

- Ethereum (Geth)
- Node.js & Express
- Next.js & React
- Ethers.js / Web3.js
- RPC + API integration

This project is ideal for Blockchain Developers, Web3 Engineers, Solidity Developers, and Advanced Beginners who want real-world experience building Layer-1 blockchain systems.

If you want to move from using blockchains to building blockchains, this project is for you.
